# Machine Learning Practices - README
This repository contains a collection of machine learning code examples and practices. Each topic is organized in its own folder and includes relevant code files, datasets, and additional resources.

Topics Covered
The repository covers a wide range of machine learning practices, including but not limited to:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning.
2. Supervised Learning.
3. Unsupervised Learning.
4. Regression.
## Regression
Regression is a fundamental topic in machine learning that deals with predicting continuous values based on input variables. It aims to model the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) by fitting a function that best represents the data.

In this repository, you will find code examples and explanations for various regression techniques. Some of the commonly covered regression methods include:

* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Elastic Net Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Gradient Boosting Regression
* Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
Along with the code, you will also find datasets or data files specific to each topic. These datasets can be used to practice and experiment with the code examples provided.
